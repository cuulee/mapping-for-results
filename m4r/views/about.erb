  <h5 id="context">Context</h5>
  <p>  Within the framework of the implementation of the new Policy on Access to Information the World Bank has worked over the last couple of months on the innovative uses of technologies to enhance the transparency and accountability of the Bank; in particular the launch of the Open Data initiative  in April, 2010 which provides free and easy access to statistics and indicators about development for all users through a new website,
  </p>
  <p>Extending this initiative to better communicate the achievement and impact of results, we have developed a Mapping for Results Platform, launched on October 7th, 2010. The objectives of this initiative are to visualize the location of investment projects to better monitor project results and impact on people; to enhance transparency and social accountability; and to enable citizens and other stakeholders to provide direct feedback on WB projects. 
  </p>
  <p>This inter-active Mapping Platform has been launched first as a beta version to enable us to make important adjustments and improvements over time. In the first phase, it will provide users with a new tool to overly disaggregated poverty and human development data (i.e. infant mortality rates) with the geographic location of WB-financed programs at the sub-national level in four countries: Haiti, Bolivia, Kenya and the Philippines.  
  </p>
  <p>More than 12,000 specific project locations for around 1,100 active Bank- financed projects across 42 countries in Sub-Saharan Affric, 27 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Indonesia and the Philippines were geo-coded by an experienced team of researchers and geo-coders using publicly-available project documentation. As part of the Bank's Open Development  approach, and to support the Apps for Development Challenge, the geo-coded project data has been made available to the public on a pilot basis through the API of the Open Data Initiative and the Mapping for Results Platform.
  </p>
  <h5 id="partners">Partners</h5>

  <p>The Mapping for Results initiative is a partnership between the World Bank and AidData , an initiative of the Development Gateway, the College of William and Mary, and Brigham Young University.   The initiative’s original goal was to map all active World Bank projects in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The initiative was so successful, however, that the Mapping for Results program was able to geocode all active projects in not only the Africa Region, but in Latin America and several Asian countries as well (Nepal, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines).  The AidData/UCDP methodology [link to AidData codebook] used to geocode World Bank projects is flexible enough to use with other donors, which has also led to the expansion of the initiative to include some African Development Bank (AfDB) projects.
  </p>
  <p>AidData brings expertise in standardizing and enhancing project-level information on development activities to the partnership.  AidData provides technical oversight and quality control for the geocoding process, which follows the AidData/UCDP methodology developed jointly with Uppsala University in Sweden.  As part of the AidData/UCDP methodology, each project is coded twice, with the results of both coders compared and combined into one final data set.  This double-coding process ensures that the geocoding process produces the most thorough and accurate location data possible.

  <h5 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h5>
  <span> What is geo-coding?</span>
  <p>Geo-coding is the process of assigning geographic coordinates to a location. For this mapping for results </p>
  <span>Which projects are included in the maps?</span> 
  <p>Only active world bank projects as of June 30, 2010 have been included in the maps. Additionally, we only have mapped lending operations and not trust funds.</p>

  <p>The following product lines were considered for the geo coding process:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>IBRD/IDA</li>
    <li>Global Environment Project</li>
    <li>GEF Medium Sized Program</li>
    <li>Guarantees</li>
    <li>Special Financing</li>
    <li>Debt Reduction Facility</li>
    <li>Carbon Offset</li>
    <li>Montreal Protocol</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Product lines that weren't geo coded:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Economic and Sector Work</li>
    <li>Global Programs and Partnerships</li>
    <li>HIPC Transfer</li>
    <li>Institutional Development Fund</li>
    <li>Recipient Executed Activities</li>
    <li>Sub-National Lending</li>
    <li>Technical Assistance (Non-lending)</li>
  </ul>

  <span>What is the source of your data on development indicators?</span>
  <span>The data for the development indicators used in our maps originates from the following sources:</span>
  <p>Extreme Poverty (MDG1)</p>
  <p>Data for Extreme Poverty comes from CIESIN</p>
  <p>Small Area Estimates of Poverty and Inequality
  </p><p>These data sets involve econometric or quantitative indirect estimation procedures that combine spatial precision (such as censuses) with substantive depth (such as surveys). They have been developed and implemented by the World Bank Development Economics Research Group and colleagues, in collaboration with country teams for the implementation of Poverty Reduction Strategy Programmes.</p>
  <p>Though spatial information may be used in the process of generating these estimates, the spatial data is generally separated prior to the analysis, reporting and dissemination of the poverty estimates. Thus, CIESIN’s database of sub-national small area estimates contains poverty and inequality data with reconstructed boundary information, using basic geographic information system (GIS) tools. (Text obtained from the source of data at: http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/povmap/methods_nat_sae.jsp)</p>
  <p>Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)</p>
  <p>http://www.measuredhs.com/</p>
  <p>The MEASURE DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys) Project is responsible for collecting and disseminating accurate, nationally representative data on health and population in developing countries. The project is implemented by Macro International, Inc. and is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) with contributions from other donors such as UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, UNAIDS.
  </p>
  <h5>Malnutrition (MDG1)</h5>
  <p>Malnutrition prevalence, height for age (% of children under 5)
  </p><p>Prevalence of child malnutrition is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age (stunting) is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. For children up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the WHO's new child growth standards released in 2006. Source: World Health Organization, Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition.
  </p><p>Catalog Sources: World Development Indicators
  </p>
  <h5>Infant Mortality (MDG4) </h5>

  <p>Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births) Infant mortality rate is the number of infants dying before reaching one year of age, per 1,000 live births in a given year. Source: Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UNICEF, WHO, World Bank, UNPD, universities and research institutions).

  <h5>Births attended (MDG5) 
  </h5>
  <p>Births attended by skilled health staff (% of total), are the percentage of deliveries attended by personnel trained to give the necessary supervision, care, and advice to women during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period; to conduct deliveries on their own; and to care for newborns. Source: UNICEF, State of the World's Children, Childinfo, and Demographic and Health Surveys by Macro International.
  </p>
  <h5>What is the source of your population data?</h5>
  <h5>Statoids</h5>
  <p>The land area of the world is divided into countries (1). Most of the countries are, in turn, divided into smaller units. These units may be called states, provinces, regions, governorates, and so on. A phrase that describes them all is "major administrative divisions of countries". This page uses the term "statoid" for short. Since the word has no other accepted meaning (2), it can be used as a search term on search engines to target this site. The 'a' of statoid is long.
</p>
  <p>This page is a guide to Internet sites about the statoids of each country. It can be used independently, but it is meant to be an update to the book "Administrative Subdivisions of Countries", by Gwillim Law (McFarland &amp; Company, Jefferson, North Carolina) (3). The international standard ISO 3166 is the source for the list of countries. As a result, some dependencies, and a few integral parts of larger countries, are listed as if they were separate countries
  </p>

  <span>What is the source of your project information?</span>

  <p>Project documentation used by Geo-coders is publicly available through <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/">The World Bank Projects &amp; Operations Portal</a></p>

  <p>The World Bank carries out projects and provides a wide variety of analytical and advisory services to help meet the development needs of individual countries and the international community. Summary operational reports are provided in the Portal.
  </p>
  <p>The following data has been obtained from this source:
  </p>
  <h5>Project Counts</h5>
  <p>Is the total number of active projects at the first and second sub-national levels e.g. provinces, departments, districts, municipalities. 
  </p> 
  <h5>Project Activities</h5>
  <p>The maps by sector display  the number of activities of a given World Bank project. For example a project in health may have different hospital locations; the Project Activities layer will show all these locations on the map
  </p>
  <p>Project locations listed in ISDS, PAD, EA, as well as other project documents were included in the project. Although this information is publicly available our Mapping for Results platform makes this information easily accessible and increases transparency and accountability.  In cases where little project documentation or location information is available, project task leaders were contacted to request additional location information. 
  </p>
  <p>What data is used to create the geographic boundaries used in the maps?
  </p>
  <p>We utilized the most accurate and recent data to create the boundaries for our maps. 
  </p>
  <p>For Bolivia, we used data from <a href="http://www.unsalb.org/" title="HOME">UNSALB</a>.</p>

  <p>The Second Administrative Level Boundaries data set project (SALB) was launched in 2001 in the context of the activities of the UN Geographic Information Working Group (UNGIWG) and has for objective to provide access to a working platform for the collection, management, visualization and sharing of sub national data and information in a seamless way from the national to the global level.
  </p>

  <p>This platform is developed in collaboration with and validated by the National Mapping Agencies (NMA) of each UN Member State and results in a database which contains:
  </p>
  <ul>         
    <li>National Mapping Agencies contact information,</li>
    <li>Coded historic changes starting from 1990 for the 1st sub national level and from 2000 for the 2nd sub national level,</li>
    <li>Seamless GIS maps corresponding to the different situations observed since January 2000.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For Haiti and the Phillipines we used data from <a href="http://www.gadm.org/" title="Global Administrative Areas | Boundaries without limits">GADM</a>.</p>

  <p>GADM is a spatial database of the location of the world's administrative areas (or adminstrative boundaries) for use in GIS and similar software. Administrative areas in this database are countries and lower level subdivisions such as provinces, departments, bibhag, bundeslander, daerah istimewa, fivondronana, krong, landsvæðun, opština, sous-préfectures, counties, and thana. GADM describes where these administrative areas are (the "spatial features"), and for each area it provides some attributes, foremost being the name and variant names.

  Kenya Data:


  <h5>Are national projects included in the maps?
  </h5>
  <p>National and Budget support projects are not represented in the map, but are listed below in the dashboard. 
  </p>
  <h5>How precise are the project locations shown in your maps?
  </h5>
  <p>The precision of each project is dependent on the quality of the available project documentation. Sources vary in the precision that locations are reported; sometimes the exact location is named and in other instances the general area is reported. The system of georeferencing used by the World Bank copes with coordinates in four main levels, ranging from point locations, through two administrative divisions, to the country level.  
  </p>
  <h5>How can I tell what each point represents?</h5>
  <p>Eight precision categories are connected to the coordinates in order for researchers to select subsets of the dataset that contain different levels of precision. When selecting a single project activity, a window will appear including a description of the precision of that location.
  </p>
  <h5>Is this information up to date? </h5>

  <p>All project information included in our maps and platform is updated as of June 30, 2010</p>

  <h5>Can I download your project data?</h5>

  <p>Yes, project activity data can be downloaded here (Insert Link).</p>
