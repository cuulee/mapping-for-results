	<p>The Mapping for Results Platform visualizes the geographic location of WB-financed projects at the sub-national level.</p>


	<p>The main objectives of the program are (i) to support the monitoring and reporting of results by providing users with an analytical tool to analyze and visualize the geographic location of Bank-funded projects at the sub-national level ; (ii) to improve aid effectiveness by enhanced transparency and accountability of donor-funded operations and (iii) to strengthen the participation of multiple stakeholders, including civil society organizations and citizen groups in the Bank’s work at the country level.</p>


	<p>This inter-active Mapping Platform has been launched first as a beta version to enable us to make important adjustments and improvements over time. In the first phase, it will provide users with a new tool to overlay disaggregated poverty and human development data (i.e. infant mortality rates) with the geographic location of WB-financed programs at the sub-national level in four countries: Bolivia, Kenya and the Philippines.</p>


	<p>More than 12,000 specific project locations for 1,251 active Bank- financed projects across 42 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, 27 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines were geo-coded by an experienced team of researchers and geo-coders using publicly-available project documentation. As part of the Bank's Open Development approach, and to support the Apps for Development Challenge, the geo-coded project data has been made available to the public on a pilot basis through the API of the Open Data Initiative and the Mapping for Results Platform.</p>


	<h1 id="Partners">Partners<a href="#Partners" class="wiki-anchor"></a></h1>


	<p>The Mapping for Results initiative is a partnership between the World Bank and <a href="http://www.aiddata.org/home/index" class="external">AidData</a>. AidData is an initiative of the Development Gateway, the College of William and Mary, and Brigham Young University. AidData brings expertise in standardizing and enhancing project-level information on development activities to the partnership. AidData provides technical oversight and quality control for the geocoding process, which follows the UCDP/AidData methodology developed jointly with Uppsala University in Sweden. As part of the UCDP/AidData methodology, each project is coded twice, with the results of both coders compared and combined into one final data set. This double-coding process ensures that the geocoding process produces the most thorough and accurate location data possible. In addition to geocoding World Bank projects, the flexibile methodology developed by UCDP/AidData has allowed it to geocode projects from other donors.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.fortiusone.com/" class="external">FortiusOne</a> develops the underlying GeoIQ platform that powers the Mapping for Results Initiative. GeoIQ, which is also available for public use through <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/" class="external">Geocommons</a>, enables easy collaborative sharing of data, visualizations, and analysis. FortiusOne supports GeoIQ platform in use by Federal Government Agencies, NGO's such as United Nations GRID-Arendal, and numerous global citizens in engaging in conversations and open data through mapping.</p>


	<p><a href="http://blog.blueraster.com/" class="external">Blue Raster</a> delivers interactive web mapping applications for clients globally. Blue Raster collaborates with many international organizations including World Bank and USAID to provide the tools to visualize and better understand data in a geographic context.</p>


	<h1 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions">Frequently Asked Questions<a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="wiki-anchor"></a></h1>


	<h2 id="What-is-geo-coding">What is geo-coding?<a href="#What-is-geo-coding" class="wiki-anchor"></a></h2>


	<p>Geo-coding is the process of mapping foreign aid projects to the location of their intended recipients. The Mapping for Results initiative used the UCDP/AidData coding methodology which assigns latitudes and longitudes to project locations, while also specifying the geographic precision and scope of the location (i.e. city, district, province, country).</p>


	<h2 id="Which-projects-are-included-in-the-maps">Which projects are included in the maps?<a href="#Which-projects-are-included-in-the-maps" class="wiki-anchor"></a></h2>


	<p>The Mapping Platform visualizes all active World Bank projects as of June 30, 2010. It is important to note that our mapping initiative focuses on mapping investment projects working at the country level.</p>


	<p>The following product lines were considered for the geo coding process:</p>


	<p>IBRD/IDA<br />Global Environment Project<br />GEF Medium Sized Program<br />Guarantees<br />Special Financing<br />Debt Reduction Facility<br />Carbon Offset<br />Montreal Protocol</p>


	<p>The following type of projects and non-lending services were not geo-coded, since these type of activities do not lend itself to being mapped:</p>


	<p>Economic and Sector Work<br />Global Programs and Partnerships<br />HIPC Transfer<br />Institutional Development Fund<br />Recipient Executed Activities<br />Sub-National Lending<br />Technical Assistance (Non-lending)<br />What is the source of your data on development indicators? Extreme Poverty (MDG1)<br />Small Area Estimates of Poverty and Inequality</p>


	<p>These data sets involve econometric or quantitative indirect estimation procedures that combine spatial precision (such as censuses) with substantive depth (such as surveys). They have been developed and implemented by the World Bank Development Economics Research Group and colleagues, in collaboration with country teams for the implementation of Poverty Reduction Strategy Programmes.</p>


	<p>Though spatial information may be used in the process of generating these estimates, the spatial data is generally separated prior to the analysis, reporting and dissemination of the poverty estimates. Thus, CIESIN’s database of sub-national small area estimates contains poverty and inequality data with reconstructed boundary information, using basic geographic information system (GIS) tools. (Text obtained from the source of data at: <a class="external" href="http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/povmap/methods_nat_sae.jsp">http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/povmap/methods_nat_sae.jsp</a>)</p>

	<p>Malnutrition prevalence, weight for age (% of children under 5)</p>


	<p>Malnutrition prevalence, weight for age (% of children under 5): Prevalence of child malnutrition is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age (stunting) is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. For children up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the WHO's new child growth standards released in 2006.</p>

	<p>Project documentation used by Geo-coders is publicly available through The World Bank Projects &#38; Operations Portal</p>


	<p>The World Bank carries out projects and provides a wide variety of analytical and advisory services to help meet the development needs of individual countries and the international community. Summary operational reports are provided in the Portal.</p>


	<p>The following data has been obtained from this source:</p>


	<p><strong>Project Counts</strong><br />The total number of active projects at the first and second sub-national levels e.g. provinces, departments, districts, municipalities.</p>


	<p><strong>Project Locations</strong><br />The maps by sector display the number of locations of a given World Bank project. For example a project in health may have different hospital locations; the Project Locations layer will show all these locations on the map</p>


	<p>Project locations of planned activities according to the project documentation (i.e. Project Appraisal Document, Environmental Assessment, Integrated Safeguard Data Sheet) were used to geo-code the project’s locations. While this information has been publicly available through the Bank’s project database, the Mapping for Results Platform makes this information easily accessible and increases transparency and accountability. In cases where little project documentation or location information is available, project task leaders were contacted to request additional location information.</p>

	<p>The Mapping Platform uses the Bank’s sector classification: To Banks major sectors are included in the maps, each of them is sub classified in sub sectors:</p>


	<p>Agriculture, Fishing, and Forestry<br />Public Administration, Law, and Justice<br />Information and Communications<br />Education<br />Finance<br />Health and Other Social Services<br />Industry and Trade<br />Energy and Mining<br />Transportation<br />Water, Sanitation, and Flood Protection<br />Are national projects included in the maps?<br />National and budget support projects are not visualized in the map, but are listed below in the dashboard.</p>

	<p>The Mapping for Results platform is being launched as a beta version, since we are currently working on enhancing the availability of geo-coded project locations across all Bank projects. For now, the precision of each project is dependent on the quality of the available project documentation, since a standardized reporting mechanism for the locations of Bank projects is currently still under development. Thus, sources vary in the precision dependent on the available data currently being reported in the project documentation. For most projects the locations are being reported; however sometimes the exact location is not available, and instead the general project area (i.e. region or districts) is reported. The system of georeferencing used by the World Bank copes with coordinates in four main levels, ranging from point locations, through two administrative divisions, to the country level.</p>


	<h2 id="How-can-I-tell-what-each-point-represents">How can I tell what each point represents?<a href="#How-can-I-tell-what-each-point-represents" class="wiki-anchor"></a></h2>


	<p>Eight precision categories are connected to the coordinates in order for researchers to select subsets of the dataset that contain different levels of precision. When selecting a single project location point, a window will appear including a description of the precision of that location.</p>
