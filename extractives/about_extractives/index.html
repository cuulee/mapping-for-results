<h3>Minerals and Mining Data</h3>
<h2>Industrial Mine Data</h2>
<p>The data about industrial mines in Ghana came from multiple sources.</p>
<p>The locations of industrial mines were identified using company declarations and Google Earth to locate the approximate coordinates of the mine. 
<p>The <a href="http://eiti.org/">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative </a> (EITI) reports provided on the <a href="http://www.geiti.gov.gh/site/">Ghana EITI website</a> were the source of the following information: royalty, tax and fee payments by mining companies; reported government receipts of royalty, tax and fee payments; disbursements owed to districts by the central government from mineral royalties; reported disbursements received by districts. Ghana EITI has only released reports for the years 2004 to 2008. </p>
<p>Gold production data was provided in a Ghana <a href="http://www.ghana-mining.org/ghanaims/Institutions/GeologicalSurveyDepartmentGSD/tabid/156/Default.aspx">Geological Survey Department</a> report titled Performance of the Mining Industry in 2009.
</p><p>Company names, website URLs and dates of entry into mining in Ghana were collected from individual company websites, when available. </p>
<h2>Mineral Deposit Location Data</h2>
<p>The point locations and types of mineral deposits were provided by the Ghana <a href="http://www.ghana-mining.org/ghanaims/Institutions/GeologicalSurveyDepartmentGSD/tabid/156/Default.aspx">Geological Survey Department</a>.
</p><h2>Oil and Gas Data</h2>
<p>The data on oil and gas in Ghana came from multiple sources. 
</p><p>Information posted on the <a href="http://gnpcghana.com/home/">Ghana National Petroleum Corporation</a> (GNPC) website and the websites of individual companies provided data on the extent and location of commercial oil fields; the presence of exploration wells; the presence of production wells; oil discoveries; the boundaries of oil lease blocks; the ownership stake of the GNPC in each oil block and well; the date work was initiated in Ghana; and the financial interests of the various companies in each oil block and well. 
</p><p>Oil sales and oil production values were collected from GNPC official statements and news media reports. The sale value of the GNPC’s first oil lift is the total received by the Bank of Ghana received on April 8th, as reported <a href="http://ghanaian-chronicle.com/news/other-news/ghana-earned-112m-from-first-oil-lifting-2/">here</a>. The value of the sale was converted from U.S. dollars to Ghana Cedis using the April 8th average exchange rate reported by <a href="http://www.forexpros.com/">Forexpros.com</a>. Oil sale values were not available for the Saltpond field. Oil production values for the Jubilee field were taken from <a href="http://www.ghanaoilwatch.org/">Ghana Oil Watch</a>’s report on <a href="http://www.ghanaoilwatch.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1490:ghanas-crude-oil-export-was-4842-million-for-the-first-quarter-of-2011&catid=6:ghana-oil-a-gas-news&Itemid=27">lifting schedules and reported lift amounts</a>, and represents the total amount lifted between the start of production in January, 2011, to the March 19th lift by Tullow Plc and E.O. Group. Oil production for the Saltpond field was taken from the GNPC’s <a href="http://www.gnpcghana.com/_upload/general/saltpondfield_sopcl.pdf">Saltpond Field – SOPCL petroleum agreement</a> posted on its website, and represents the total amount lifted between June 2003 and November 2008. 
</p><p>Links to petroleum agreements were compiled from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, when possible. Otherwise, they were collected from the GNPC website <a href="http://www.gnpcghana.com/activities/details.asp?expID=11">Petroleum Agreements page</a>.</p>
<h2>World Bank Project Data</h2>
<p>Charts on sector distribution, list of financed activities, and number/volume of financed activities include all active Bank-financed activities under all 12 "lending" product lines. The dataset of financed activities is provided and regularly updated through the <a href="http://api.worldbank.org/projects">Open Data API</a>. Out of these, so far, 1264 activities have been mapped by the Spring Meetings 2011 under the following product lines: IBRD/IDA, Global Environment Project, Special Financing, Montreal Protocol, GEF Medium Sized Programs, Guarantees, Debt Reduction Facility, and Carbon Offsets. Locations of mapped financed activities are as of February 8, 2011.
</p><h2>International Finance Corporation Project Data</h2>
<p>The locations of and information about International Finance Corporation (IFC) projects specifically related to oil, gas and mining were collected from project information available at the <a href="http://www.ifc.org/projects">IFC’s project portal</a>.  The approach for identifying and coding IFC activity locations followed the <a href="http://maps.worldbank.org/about/methodology">methodology used by Mapping for Results</a> to geocode World Bank-financed activities. 
</p><h3>Development Indicators
</h3><p>A description of the two data sources used for development indicators in the Mapping the Extractives Industries platform are provided below, followed by descriptions of the indicators. 
</p><p>Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) were used for indicators of Malnutrition, Infant Mortality and Births Attended by a Skilled Provider. The <a href="http://www.measuredhs.com/">MEASURE DHS</a> (Demographic and Health Surveys) Project is responsible for collecting and disseminating accurate, nationally representative data on health and population in developing countries. The project is implemented by Macro International, Inc. and is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) with contributions from other donors such as UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, UNAIDS. 
</p><p>The Statoids website was consulted for population data. <a href="http://www.statoids.com/">Statoids</a> provides sub-national population data by first and second level administrative divisions for each country. 
</p><h2>Malnutrition 
</h2><p>Malnutrition prevalence, weight for age (% of children under 5): Prevalence of child malnutrition is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age (stunting) is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. For children up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the WHO's new child growth standards released in 2006. Source: <a href="http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=14">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> by Macro International. Catalog Sources: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>. 
</p><h2>Infant Mortality</h2> 
<p>Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births): Infant mortality rate is the number of infants dying before reaching one year of age, per 1,000 live births in a given year. Source: <a href="http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=14">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> by Macro International. Catalog Sources: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>. 
</p><h2>Births Attended by a Skilled Provider
</h2><p>Births attended by skilled health staff (% of total): Percentage of deliveries attended by personnel trained to give the necessary supervision, care, and advice to women during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period; to conduct deliveries on their own; and to care for newborns. Source: <a href="http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=14">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> by Macro International. Catalog Sources: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>. 
</p><h2>Unemployment</h2>
<p>Unemployment rate (percentage): The percentage of the population in each first-order administrative unit that were not employed in the 12 months prior to the survey. Source: <a href="http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=14">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> by Macro International. Catalog Sources: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>. 
</p><h2>Wealth Quintile</h2>
<p>Proportion in each wealth quintile (percentage): Wealth quintile rates for each region were used. The wealth quintile uses information on household ownership of consumer items, ranging from a television to a bicycle or car, as well as dwelling characteristics, such as source of drinking water, sanitation facilities, and type of flooring material. Each asset was assigned a weight (factor score) generated through principal components analysis, and the resulting asset scores were standardized in relation to a normal distribution. Each household was then assigned a score for each asset, and the scores were summed for each household; individuals were ranked according to the total score of the household in which they resided. The sample was then divided into quintiles from one (lowest) to five (highest). Source: <a href="http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=14">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> by Macro International.
</p><h2>Population</h2>
<p>Population (count of individuals by second-order administrative unit): The estimated number of individuals living in each second-order administrative unit at the time of the 2000 Ghana Census. The administrative units used in this mapping were those that were current as of the 2000 census. Source: 2000 Ghana Census (from <a href="http://www.statoids.com/">Statoids</a>).
</p><h2>Population Density</h2>
<p>Population density (persons per square kilometer): The estimated population density reported as the number of persons per square kilometer for each second-order administrative unit. This data was calculated by dividing the population counts reported in the 2000 Ghana Census by the area of each second-order administrative unit. The area was derived from the Global Administrative Unit Layers spatial data using a Geographic Information System (see below). Sources: 2000 Ghana Census (from <a href="http://www.statoids.com/">Statoids</a>).
</p><h2>Geographic boundaries</h2>
<p>The maps displayed on the World Bank web site are for reference only. The boundaries, colors, denominations and any other information shown on these maps do not imply, on the part of the World Bank Group, any judgment on the legal status of any territory, or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries. 
</p>
<h3>Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)</h3>
<h2>Countries: Ghana (2005)</h2>
<p>The <a href=" http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=12691">Global Administrative Unit Layers</a> is an initiative implemented by FAO within the <a href=" http://www.foodsecinfoaction.org/News/news_06_06.htm">EC-FAO Food Security Programme</a> funded by the European Commission. The GAUL aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable spatial information on administrative units for all the countries in the world, providing a contribution to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. The GAUL sub-national boundaries for Ghana were last updated in 2005, and do not include several changes made since then to the number and shape of second-order administrative units in the country.
